Hi!! We have a repo!


Here a a few beginning tutorials for Neural Networks. 
https://machinelearningmastery.com/building-a-regression-model-in-pytorch/
https://www.guru99.com/pytorch-tutorial.html (This one has regression and classification.)

https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-beginners-an-introduction-to-neural-networks-d49f22d238f9 (this one goes through a lot of the details that I was trying to explain today. Good one for never seeing a NN before.)
